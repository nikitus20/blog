## Hello everyone!

I'm Nikita, a PhD student at MIT, fortunate to work under the guidance of Professor [Yury Polyanskiy](https://people.lids.mit.edu/yp/homepage/). 
With a long history of competing in mathematical olympiads, I'm thrilled by recent breakthroughs in AI reasoning, such as those from [DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/ai-solves-imo-problems-at-silver-medal-level/) and [OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/). That is why I'm particularly interested in uncovering the fundamental properties that enhance AI interpretability, stability, and efficiency.

My current research is dedicated to the theoretical properties of transformers, viewed through the lens of dynamical systems. For more details, feel free to explore my research page.
