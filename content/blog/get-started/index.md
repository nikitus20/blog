## Welcome ðŸ‘‹

I am happy to present my first graduate [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04990) as a [poster](https://neurips.cc/media/PosterPDFs/NeurIPS%202024/95352.png?t=1734050775.9867222) at NeurIPS 2024. The main goal of this work is to better understand self-attention from theoretical perspective, by modeling propagation of tokens through layers as an interacting particle system.
